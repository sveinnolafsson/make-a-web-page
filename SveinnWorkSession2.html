<!-- Use span sparingly and div to divide chunks of information -->
  <div>
    <h2>Stage 0</h2>
    <br>
  <h3>Reminder of the building blocks of the Internet, as in the protocols and how do they work;</h3>
<ul>
<li>what is a server</li>
<li>what does a browser do</li>
<li>Internet protocol </li>
<li>hypertext protocol</li>
</ul>
A web page is a document written in Hypertext markup language. A browser fetches information from a server and feeds them through a browser as a web page. <br>
Code is instructions made by a programmer in a language (code) that a computer can understand and execute.<br>
Computers are stupid in the way that if you donâ€™t tell them in the exact correct way what to do (correct syntax) they will not execute. With the correct syntax, on the other hand, you can make them do some pretty amazing things.<br>
<em>
Don't try to memorise everything, look it up when you need to.
</em><br><br>
<h3>HTML tags:</h3>An open-ended (void) tag like the img src tag do not need an ending tag and a block tag like element will need one. Most tags have an opening and a closing tag.<br>
An attribute is the property of a tag.<br>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Stage 1</h2><br>
<ul>
  <li>What does it mean to write code</li>
  <li>Avoid unnecessary repetition</li>
  <li>Structure in code to make the computer understand</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Knowledge gap - scattered facts vs structured </li>
  <li>Understanding - Reflection</li>
  <li>Skills gap - ability to execute - Practice</li>
</ul>
<br>
  <h3>Creating a structured document with HTML</h3>
  <p><b>Developer tools</b><br>
  </p>
  <p>Elements (inside each tag) are inline or block. A block element forms an invisible box around their content
    Tree-like structure (hierarchy): You can new an element (tag) inside other elements.<br>
    Indentation shows nesting hierarchically<br>
  Text editors: some are designed for programming, e.g. generate a closing tag automatically. Some show elements in different colors and have other helpful features.</p>

  <h3>Add style to the HTML file</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Link to the style file, ends with .css</li>
    <li>Have it in the head part</li>
    <li>Add a body part</li>
    <li>Have the main text of the file in the body part</li>
  </ul>
<p>You can also add a style at the top of the file itself</p>
  </div><div>
  <h3>CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h3>
  <p>You can have several css files to control different levels of styles<br>
    Most specific rule applies to all<br>
    That is the Cascading in CSS</p>
  <h4>Inheritance</h4>
  <p>Properties are applied to an element and all its descendants.<br>
    Box-related properties are not inherited.<br>
    Main properties inherited are color, font, spacing, line height, list styles, text-align, text indenting, white space and word-spacing. <br>
    Properties that are not inherited are background, border, height and width plus min- and max height and width, margin outline, padding, vertical-align and more.</p>
  <p><br>
    <em>You first write a selector, like  p { <br>
    }<br>
    You designate a class with . in front<br>
    and attribute :  value;</em></p>
  <p>Not necessary to remember them all<br>
    Go to css documentation, see link the Instructor notes</p>
  <p>Styles also appear in Word documents, Google docs and so on.</p></div><div>
  <h3>Box sizing in css</h3>
  <p>An easy tool is available in css: <br>
    </p>
  <p>*{<br>
    box-sizing: border-box;<br>
    }</p>
  <p>Older browsers may not handle this, so add<br>
    browser-specific prefixes, like this:</p>
  <p>*{<br>
    -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;<br>
    -moz-box-sizing: border-box;<br>
    -ms-box-sizing: border-box;<br>
    box-sizing: border-box;<br>
    }</p>
  <p>You can set size with percentage, in which case it resizes according to the screen or box size.<br>
    You can set size with pixels, in which case it is set.<br>
    You can also have max and min value  </p>
  <p><br>
</p>

        <h3>
          Main issues learned from stage 1:      
        </h3><ul>
      <li>Use structured code, so that the computer understands it  </li>     
      <li>Maintain clarity in code, so it is easier to check the code, fix error or change the code      </li> 
<li>Be consistent, so that same style and same class is coded the same way</li>       
      <li>Avoid repetition. Use one set of instructions for the same thing throughout, so for instance to declare the same style of format in your file, declare it once and refer to it, do not repeat it.      
      </li></ul></div>
